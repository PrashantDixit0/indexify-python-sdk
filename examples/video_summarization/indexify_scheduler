## Graph Registration

1. Create a graph with compute functions and a start node.
2. Register the graph with the Indexify service.
3. The code of the graph is serialized and stored with the graph definition.
4. The client also sends a static version of the graph definition.


## Scheduling Steps

1. Create a task for the first node of the graph. Match the constraints.
2. Run the function and store the outputs.
3. The scheduler reads all the edges from the current node.
4. The scheduler looks if there are any router functions for the current node.
5. If there are router functions, the scheduler creates a new task for the router functions
6. The router functions has to return names of valid edges from the current node.
7. The scheduler also creates tasks to any of the edges defined statically for the current node.
8. The scheduler creates the tasks for the edges that the routers returned.
9. Repeat for all the nodes.


## Ingestion Steps
1. Ingest an object and serialize them to JSON.
2. Store them in the DB. 
3. Tell the scheduler about the data being ingested and the ID and the storage location.
